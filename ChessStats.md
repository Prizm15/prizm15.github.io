## Chess Statistics Tableau Dashboard

**Project description:** Inspired by the recent boom in chess players from the popularity of the Queen's Gambit on Netflix, I decided to see for myself what insights I could gather from data currently available from the FIDE, the international governing body for chess regulations and rankings. After parsing through this XML data using Python, I was able to view how players and countries related to each other in terms of chess rankings. 

### 1. Rating vs. Age

Age seemed to have a smaller role to play in the distribution of titles than I thought. Of course, lower titles tended to be younger audiences, but after 1750 the distribution is relatively flat. I included the average for both rating and age to show the data is skewed slightly right. This is probably a result of chess reaching a much more global audience through Netflix and therefore has a larger, younger playerbase.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
