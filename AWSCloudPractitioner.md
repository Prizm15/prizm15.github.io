## AWS Cloud Practitioner



**Certification description:** I found this certification very helpful in learning the fundamentals of the cloud from a users perspective. Among the biggest takeaways are the power of EC2 instances for hosting applications, AWS Lambda for quick execution of code functions, and the IAM specific to AWS which allows administrators to manage permissions and access to EC2 instances and other services on their AWS organizations. 

**Skills:**
* Understanding of AWS Cloud and its global infrastructure
* AWS Cloud architectural principles
* Understanding security compliance and the shared responsibility model
* Knowledge of key services on AWS platform and common use cases
* Understanding of AWS billing, account management, and pricing models

### IAM

Identity and Access Management was a new concept to me. However, AWS makes it simple and easy to not only form my own organization but also to assign roles and groups to my users. I was able to experiment with this service as part of the free tier, and it helped me understand much more about what an organizational structure may look like in the cloud.

### Billing and pricing models

Billing was another area I was able to learn and interact with in my AWS Management Console. Billing was important as I wanted to stay within the free tier. It really helped me put into perspective my EC2 instances and how much money could be saved by using the cloud as opposed to dedicated systems.

### General Reflection

I am extremely grateful that I had the opportunity to study and achieve this certification. I learned about cloud infrastructure, identity and access management, security compliance, billing and pricing, and so much more within the cloud. AWS is a powerful solution and I did not understand its potential until interacting with it hands-on.
