## AWS Cloud Practitioner

**Certification description:** I found this certification very helpful in learning the fundamentals of the cloud from a users perspective. Among the biggest takeaways are the power of EC2 instances for hosting applications, AWS Lambda for quick execution of code functions, and the IAM specific to AWS which allows administrators to manage permissions and access to EC2 instances and other services on their AWS organizations. 

**Skills:**
* Understanding of AWS Cloud and its global infrastructure
* AWS Cloud architectural principles
